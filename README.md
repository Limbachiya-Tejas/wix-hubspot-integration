# wix-hubspot-integration
The Wix-HubSpot integration script syncs form submissions from a Google Sheet to HubSpot. It checks if a contact exists by email; if found, it creates a deal linked to the contact. If not, it creates a new contact and deal. The integration automates contact and deal creation, streamlining data flow between Wix, Google Sheets, and HubSpot.
